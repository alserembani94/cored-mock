> Currently this template is not released yet, so please use it carefully.

Cored is a free and open-source admin dashboard, carefully crafted for your engine, powered by Vue 3!

- **Well-crafted components**. All of the components are coded natively using SCSS pre-processors, so you can freely customize each components to your liking.
- **Modularized state  management**. Leveraging the power of Vuex 4.x, you can craft your state management solution based on your needs.
- **Typescript-ready**. You can use the power of typescript to make your code typed to avoid type-related bugs of javascript.
- **Progressive Web Apps**. You don't have to worry about whether the app is PWA-ready or not, because we put it in place for you!
- **Customizable**. You can quickly build your dashboard by fully customising color themes, sizes according to your aesthetics!
